# Novel Approach to Multilingual Hate Speech Detection using Context Engine
 In today's digital age, hate speech has become a pressing issue as more people engage in online communication. Despite efforts to combat it, existing detection systems often struggle to accurately identify and address hate speech due to linguistic and cultural complexities. This paper proposes a hybrid model that integrates various techniques to enhance hate speech detection across diverse linguistic landscapes. By combining translation capabilities, tokenization, and encoding techniques with contextual understanding and prompt-based confirmation, the model aims to achieve higher accuracy in identifying and categorizing hate speech. Through comprehensive testing using real-time Twitter data, we evaluate the model's performance across different languages, contexts, and offensive content. Results demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and precision compared to existing models, highlighting the efficacy of the proposed approach. Moving forward, continued refinement and collaboration are essential to further enhance hate speech detection and promote a safer, more inclusive online environment.
